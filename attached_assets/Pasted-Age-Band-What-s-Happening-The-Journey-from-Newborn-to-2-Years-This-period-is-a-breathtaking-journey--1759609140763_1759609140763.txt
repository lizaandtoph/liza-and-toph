Age Band	What's Happening
The Journey from Newborn to 2 Years	This period is a breathtaking journey from a purely sensory being, completely dependent on caregivers, to a mobile, vocal, and independent little person. A newborn is a Sensory Being, learning about the world through touch, sight, and sound. As they master their body and find their voice, they transform into an Independent Explorer, eager to move, interact, and assert their will on the world around them. Our goal is to design a safe and stimulating environment that nurtures this explosion of growth.
The Journey from 18 Months to 3 Years	The journey from 18 months to age three is a magical transition. A young toddler is a physical Explorer, driven by a powerful need to test their limits, master their movements, and declare their independence with a joyful "me do it!" As they grow, their focus turns from the purely physical to the social and imaginative. A new, creative world blossoms, and they become a Budding Storyteller, using language and pretend play to make sense of their experiences and connect with others. Our goal is to design spaces that support this incredible journey from physical discovery to imaginative creation.
The Journey from 2 to 5 Years	This three-year span is a period of pure magic, where the world of imagination reigns supreme. A two-year-old is an Eager Imitator, watching the world around them and practicing what they see through simple, parallel play. As their social and cognitive worlds explode, they transform into an Imaginative Creator, capable of inventing elaborate worlds, negotiating roles with friends, and using play to make sense of everything. Our goal is to provide the raw materials—the props, the spaces, and the freedom—for their imagination to take flight.
The Journey from 3 to 6 Years	This stage is defined by the blossoming of a child's inner world. A three-year-old is a Magical Thinker, whose play is a wonderful, free-flowing exploration of their imagination without regard for the rules of reality. As they approach age six, their cognitive and social skills allow them to become an Early Planner, a child who can not only imagine a scenario but can also organize it, assign roles, and follow simple rules to bring it to life. Our goal is to create spaces that honor their magical thinking while gently introducing the tools for planning and cooperation.
The Journey from 4 to 7 Years	This period marks the critical transition from the free-form world of preschool to the more structured world of early elementary school. A four-year-old is an Enthusiastic Friend, whose social world is blossoming and whose play is imaginative and boisterous. As they approach age seven, they become a Rule-Follower, a child who finds deep satisfaction in understanding how things work, following established rules, and using logic to solve problems. Our goal is to design spaces that honor their social spirit while providing engaging challenges for their emerging logical minds.
The Journey from 5 to 8 Years	The journey from age five to eight is one of the most remarkable transformations in childhood. A five-year-old lives in a world of pure imagination, where play is about inventing stories and asking "What if...?" As they grow, a powerful new drive emerges: the desire to become a master of new skills. Play shifts towards figuring out "How to...", whether it's building a complex LEGO set or winning a board game. Their thinking follows the same path, moving from magical make-believe to more concrete, logical reasoning. Our goal is to design play environments that support and celebrate every step of this incredible journey.
The Journey from 6 to 9 Years	This period is about building and problem-solving, both with things and with friends. A six-year-old is a Concrete Thinker, just beginning to understand the world through a more logical, rule-based lens. As they grow, their ability to plan, strategize, and see things from another's perspective deepens, and they emerge as a Strategic Problem-Solver. Play becomes less about simple creation and more about building complex systems, whether it’s a LEGO city, a winning game plan, or a strong friendship. Our goal is to provide them with challenges that stretch their logical minds and opportunities to collaborate with peers.
The Journey from 7 to 10 Years	During these years, children solidify their place in the world outside the family. A seven-year-old is a Competent Peer, focused on mastering the academic and social rules of school and friendship. They are driven by a desire to "do it right." As they mature, they become an Independent Expert, a child who has developed deep knowledge and passion for their own unique interests. They are not just a member of the group; they are an individual with their own expertise to share. Our goal is to provide the tools and autonomy they need to dive deep into their passions.
The Journey from 8 to 11 Years	This stage is the bridge to adolescence, a time when social structures become paramount and a child's inner world grows more complex. An eight-year-old is a Team Player, thriving on collaboration, fairness, and mastering the rules of their social and academic worlds. As they approach the pre-teen years, they become a Budding Individual, using their skills not just to fit in, but to begin defining who they are. Their focus shifts from group success to developing a personal style and a unique sense of self. Our goal is to provide spaces that support both complex social interaction and independent, passion-driven exploration.
The Journey from 9 to 12 Years	This is the heart of the "tween" years, a dynamic period of transition from childhood toward adolescence. A nine-year-old is a Rule Master, who has become adept at understanding and even using the rules of games, friendships, and school to their advantage. As they move toward twelve, they become an Abstract Thinker, capable of looking beyond the literal rules to question, hypothesize, and form their own complex opinions about the world. Play evolves from mastering the game to inventing new ones. Our goal is to create environments that provide both the structure they need and the freedom to start thinking outside the box.
The Journey from 10 to Early Teens (13-15 Years)	This stage marks the official entry into adolescence, a period of profound self-discovery. A ten-year-old is a Confident Peer, comfortable in their social groups and competent in their skills. As they enter their teens, the central task becomes figuring out who they are, and they transform into an Identity Seeker. Their world expands beyond the here-and-now to include complex questions about their future, their beliefs, and their place in the wider world. Play evolves into passion, and hobbies become a way to test-drive future selves. Our goal is to design spaces that provide a stable home base for this exciting and sometimes tumultuous exploration.
The Journey from Preteen to Older Teen (11-13 to 15-18 Years)	This final stage of childhood is a powerful journey of consolidation and launch. The preteen (11-13) is an Emerging Individual, actively trying on different identities and figuring out where they fit in. As they move through their high school years, they become a Young Adult, a person who has begun to consolidate their identity, values, and goals, and is looking toward their future beyond the family home. Play transforms completely into adult-like leisure, passion projects, and preparation for their future. Our goal is to design spaces that provide a secure base for this final push toward independence.
