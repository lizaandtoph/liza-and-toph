5. Scoring & Mapping Specifications
Developmental Domain Scoring:
Each domain receives a confidence score based on milestone alignment:

Advanced (75%+ milestones above age): Suggest activities 6+ months ahead

On Track (50-75% age-appropriate milestones): Current age band activities

Emerging (25-50% milestones): Support with current + easier options

Refer Out (<25% milestones): Educational note to discuss with pediatrician

Schema Pattern Detection:
Primary Schema (3+ behaviors checked): Strong interest, recommend schema-specific products
Secondary Schema (2 behaviors): Emerging interest, include some options
Broad Exploration (1 each across multiple): Offer variety across schemas

Attention Band Classification:
Newborn-2yr: 5-15 minutes = typical, <5 min = support needed, >15 min = advanced

2-5yr: 10-25 minutes = typical, <10 min = support needed, >25 min = advanced

5-8yr: 15-35 minutes = typical, <15 min = support needed, >35 min = advanced

8+yr: 20-45 minutes = typical, <20 min = support needed, >45 min = advanced

6. Milestone Projection Rules
Current Stage Identification:
Use age band + milestone performance + schema patterns to determine:

Current archetype (e.g., "Physical Explorer" for 18m-3yr band)

Confidence level in placement (high/medium/low based on milestone alignment)

Shift Detection:
Ahead indicators: Meeting milestones 6+ months early, advanced schema complexity

Behind indicators: Missing 50%+ age milestones, simpler schema patterns

Typical progression: Meeting age-appropriate milestones with expected schema development

3-Year Projection:
Advanced trajectory: Move 1.5 bands forward

Typical trajectory: Move 1 band forward per year of projection

Supported trajectory: Current band plus enhanced scaffolding recommendations

7. If-Then Rules for Parent Guidance
Storage & Access Rules:
IF child dumps bins to find toys → NEED: visible, accessible storage → ACTION: low, forward-facing shelving with clear containers

IF child can't reach desired toys → NEED: independence-building → ACTION: step stool + lower storage solutions

Schema-Based Rules:
IF strong enveloping schema → NEED: nurturing materials + cozy spaces → ACTION: dolls, blankets, hideaways, fort-building materials

IF strong connecting schema → NEED: building foundations + joining materials → ACTION: magnetic tiles, train tracks, firm building surfaces

Sensory Rules:
IF sensory seeking behaviors → NEED: heavy work + input opportunities → ACTION: crash pads, weighted items, climbing structures

IF sensory avoiding patterns → NEED: calm environment + gradual exposure → ACTION: noise-reducing headphones, texture alternatives

Space Rules:
IF limited space + gross motor needs → NEED: vertical + multi-use solutions → ACTION: climbing blocks, wall-mounted storage, foldable equipment

IF shared space conflicts → NEED: boundaries + portable play → ACTION: play mats, carry caddies, quiet activity options
